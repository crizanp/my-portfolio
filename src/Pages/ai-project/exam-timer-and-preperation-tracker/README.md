Exam timer and preparation tracker

This folder contains a simple React page component: `index.js`.

Usage:
- Import and add a route to your application's router. Example path: `/ai/exam-timer-and-preperation-tracker`.
- The page stores state in localStorage under the key `exam-timer-prep-v1`.

Notes:
- This is intentionally a lightweight page (no external libs). Styles reuse existing project CSS classes like `content` and `tools-header`.
- If you want this rendered under the existing AI routes, add a Link to `/ai` or adjust router accordingly.
